== Purpose

Hardware-assisted fault isolation (HFI) is a hardware extension that supports
in-process isolation (sandboxing) of unmodified native binary code and also
integrates into existing software based fault isolation (SFI cite:[wahbe-sfi]) based
sandboxing systems, systems such as WebAssembly cite:[wasm] and Google's
Ubercage (Google Chrome's v8 JIT sandbox cite:[v8-sbx]), to improve their
performance, security, and scalability cite:[hfi].

HFI aims to provide all the capabilities needed for secure sandboxing, namely
data and control flow isolation as well as complete and efficient mediation of privileged
instructions (i.e. system calls). This specification describes the functional
properties of HFI on RISC-V, a more complete description of the background and
motivation for HFI is presented in a paper published at ASPLOS 2023 cite:[hfi].
